coreproject contains all files that are strictly relavent to the
operation of spideralgorithm.

It is organized similarly to the previous folder:

data	-	contains all accessed data
db	-	contains systems to store all classified PCs
spider	-	contains spider algorithm and helper classes
ui	-	contains main method to perform tasks
vars	- 	contains all relavent self-defined variables


All files paths should be strictly relational -- no absolute
directories.

There should be no hard coding as well. One change to the
categories.json in vars should modify the entire execution.
